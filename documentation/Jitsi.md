# Jitsi Documentation

CLinicArrivals uses Jitsi for managing video calls. 

## Setting up the conference call

The id of the meeting is pregenerated using http://meet.jit.si/{GUID}-{appointment-id}.
This is assumed to be unique for our purposes. Nothing is needed to 
set this up - the patient just joins it when the time comes. 

## Has the call started?

THere's no easy way to tell if the patient has joined the call. 
Until this is resolved, we ask the patient to SMS "Joined" in 
answer to the invitation SMS once they have joined.
